# UNSW operating system comp9201
- 2018S2
- A simple OS based on OS161
- asst1: locks, concurrency issues
- asst2: basic file syscalls, execv and fork
- asst3: virtual memory
- many bugs, I just don't want to fix them afterall
- I've done almost every thing in EOS, without paging(leave that to aos).
